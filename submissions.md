# Statement of facts

1.  Petro Energy Pty Ltd proposes to build and operate a floating LNG
    plant to process gas in the Selinka Gas Field, approximately 150 km off the coast
    of WA (**Proposal**).

2.  The _Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999_ (Cth)
    (***EPBC Act***)

2.  On 30 July 2013, the Minister approved the proposal (**Decision**). e
    Minister’s reasons for the Decision (**Reasons**) stated that:

    #.  in deciding to approve the taking of the action, the Minister had given
        strong consideration to a recent Commonwealth government policy announcement
        that it would 'streamline' environmental approval of offshore gas projects and
        ‘cut environmental green tape’ in order to ensure that the Australia offshore
        gas industry remained competitive and attractive to international investment;

    #.  he had not delayed the decision in response to FNW’s letter, as he considered that
        adequate time had been given for public comment in compliance with the
        provisions of the EPBC Act.

# Submission 1: The Minister did not make the Decision according to a rule or policy without regard to the merits of the particular case.

1.  The Minister's Reasons disclose only that the Minister "gave strong consideration"
    to the policy. The Minister had regard to the merits of the 

2.  A lawful policy is normally a relevant consideration which
    a decision-maker is bound to take into account.

3.  In the absence of any statutory or contextual indication of the weight to be
    given to factors to which a decision-maker must have regard, it is generally
    for him or her to determine the appropriate weight to be given to them.

2.  In Drake, the Court said:

> The propriety of paying regard to general policy considerations is most
> evident in a case such as the present where there are no speciﬁed
> statutory criteria for the exercise of the discretionary power and
> where the power is entrusted to a Minister of the Crown responsible to
> Parliament.

# Submission 2: The Minister’s refusal to delay the Decision was reasonable in the circumstances.

1.  Section 5(2)(g) of the _ADJR Act_ provides that the improper exercise of a power includes
    "an exercise of a power that is so unreasonable that no reasonable person
    could have so exercised the power." This provision incorporates the common law
    notion of '_Wednesbury_ unreasonableness.'

    (1986) 162 CLR 24, 41 (Mason J).

2.  The High Court considered _Wednesbury_ unreasonableness in _Li_, affirming decisions
    at first instance and on appeal to the Full Court which upheld this ground of review.
    
    

3.  This Court recently considered an application for judicial review of a Ministerial decision
    under the _EPBC Act_ in _Tarkine National Coalition_. Although the application
    was successful, the Court rejected the ground of review alleging _Wednesbury_
    unreasonableness, noting Gageler J's observation.
    

    > The above response is a persuasive one, at least in the latter two points. It
    > is difficult to see how the decision could be characterised as irrational or
    > so unreasonable that no decision-maker would make it. As Gageler J said in Li
    > at [113] “judicial determination of Wednesbury unreasonableness in Australia
    > has in practice been rare. Nothing in these reasons should be taken as
    > encouragement to greater frequency. This is a rare case”.


2.  In _Li_, the applicant sought judicial review of the Migration Review Tribunal's
    refusal to delay its decision on a visa application until the applicant
    could put certain evidence before the Tribunal.
    The decision was held to be "unreasonable in the *Wednesbury Corporation* sense"
    at first instance, on appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court, and on appeal
    to the High Court. Gageler J said:

    > Judicial determination of Wednesbury unreasonableness in Australia has in
    > practice been rare.  Nothing in these reasons should be taken as
    > encouragement to greater frequency. This is a rare case.

3.  In contrast to the refusal in _Li_, the Minister's refusal to defer the Decision
    was not 'fatal' to the applicant's interests.
