# Statement of facts

1.  Petro Energy Pty Ltd proposes to build and operate a floating LNG plant to
    process gas in the Selinka Gas Field, approximately 150 km off the coast of WA
    (**Proposal**). The Proposal is likely to emit noise and chemical pollution
    into the surrounding environment, which intersects a humpback whale migratory route.

2.  Humpback whales are a 'listed threatened species' under the _Environment
    Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999_ (Cth) (***EPBC Act***). Section 18
    of the _EPBC Act_ prohibits action that 'has or will have a significant
    impact' on a listed threatened species without the Minister's approval.

3.  Section 67 of the _EPBC Act_ provides that actions which are prohibited without
    the Minister's approval are 'controlled actions.' On 10 June 2013, the Minister
    determined that the Proposal was a controlled action.

4.  Section 87 of the _EPBC Act_ requires the Minister to choose one of several methods
    of assessing the environmental impact of a controlled action. On 10 June 2013,
    the Minister decided to assess the Proposal on referral information.

5.  Section 93 of the _EPBC Act_ provides that within 30 days of the Minister deciding
    to assess a controlled action on referral information, the Department of Sustainability,
    Environment, Water, Population and Communities (**Department**) must:

    #.  publish a draft report containing a recommendation as to whether the controlled action
        should be approved (**Report**); and

    #.  invite the public to provide comments in relation to the Report within 10 business days.

    The Department published a draft Report in respect of the Proposal on 10 July 2013.

6.  On 17 July 2013, the Applicant:

    #.  submitted several scientific studies concerning the environmental impact of
        floating LNG plants to the Department; and

    #.  asked the Minister in writing to delay his decision on the Proposal until after
        the release of a new scientific study by the International Whaling Commission,
        due to be released in early August 2013 (**Delay Request**).

7.  On 25 July 2013, the Department finalised the Report and gave it to the Minister.

8.  Section 130 of the _EPBC Act_ required the Minister to approve the Proposal within
    20 business days after receiving the finalised Report, or "such longer period as the Minister
    specifies in writing."

2.  On 30 July 2013, the Minister approved the Proposal (**Approval**) subject to conditions. The
    Minister's reasons for the Approval (**Reasons**) stated that the Minister:

    #.  had given "strong consideration" to the Commonwealth government's policy 
        of "streamlining" environmental approval of offshore gas projects and
        "cutting environmental green tape" in order to ensure that the Australia offshore
        gas industry remained competitive and attractive to international investment (**Policy**); and

    #.  refused the Delay Request as he considered that adequate time had been given for
        public comment.

10. The Applicant seeks judicial review of the Approval and the Minister's refusal of the Delay
    Request under the _Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977_ (***ADJR Act***).

# Submission 1: The Approval was not an improper exercise of power within the meaning of s 5(2)(f) of the _ADJR Act_ (inflexible application of policy).

1.  Section 5(2)(f) of the _ADJR Act_ provides that "an exercise of a discretionary power in
    accordance with a rule or policy without regard to the merits of the particular
    case" is improper.

2.  A decision-maker is normally entitled to treat government policy as a relevant
    consideration in the absence of statutory provision to the contrary. The propriety
    of paying regard to policy considerations is particular evidence where the power
    is entrusted to a Minister of the Crown responsible to Parliament.

    _Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs_ (1979) 46 FLR 409, 420 \
    (Bowen CJ, Deane J).

2.  Although the Minister's power to approve the Proposal is discretionary, it
    is confined by the statement of relevant considerations in s 136 of the _EPBC
    Act_. Section 136 is an exhaustive statement: s 136(5). However, it includes
    the broad category of "economic and social matters" as a mandatory
    consideration: s 136(1)(b).

3.  The Policy is not specifically directed at any administrative power. Rather, it
    provides that the environmental approval decisions should be "streamlined" for
    economic reasons. The Minister was entitled to take the Policy into account when
    considering "economic and social matters."

3.  In the absence of any statutory or contextual indication of the weight to be
    given to factors to which a decision-maker must have regard, it is generally
    for him or her to determine the appropriate weight to be given to them.

    _Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd_ [1986] HCA 40; \
    (1986) 162 CLR 24, 41 (Mason J).

3.  There is nothing inherently wrong in the Minister pursuing a policy which:
    
    #.  is consistent with the statute under which the relevant power is conferred;
    #.  does not preclude the Minister from taking into account relevant considerations; and
    #.  does not require the Minister to take into account irrelevant considerations.

    _NEAT Domestic Trading v AWB Ltd_ (2003) 216 CLR 277, 289 [24] (Gleeson CJ).

5.  Although the Minister gave "strong consideration" to the Policy, he gave genuine
    consideration to the merits of the Proposal before approving it, as evidenced by
    the Minister's imposition of detailed conditions on the Proposal.

# Submission 2: The Minister's refusal of the Delay Request was not an improper exercise of power within the meaning of s 5(2)(g) of the _ADJR Act_ (unreasonableness).

1.  Section 5(2)(g) of the _ADJR Act_ provides that "an exercise of a power
    that is so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have so exercised the
    power" is improper. Section 5(2)(g) reflects the common law notion of
    '_Wednesbury_ unreasonableness.'

    _Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation_ [1948] 1 KB 223, \
     230 (Lord Green MR).

    _Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd_ [1986] HCA 40; \
    (1986) 162 CLR 24, 41 (Mason J).

2.  By requiring the Minister to make decisions within prescribed time periods, s 130 of
    the _EPBC Act_ reflects the legislature's intention, expressed in s 3(2)(d),
    that the environmental assessment and approval process should be "efficient and timely."

3.  Section 130(1A) of the _EPBC Act_ grants the Minister a discretion to delay his decision
    for "such longer period as the Minister specifies in writing." The discretion is unconfined
    by statutory criteria.

2.  In _Li_, the High Court affirmed the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court
    granting judicial review of the Migration Review Tribunal's refusal to delay a decision.
    Gageler J discussed _Wednesbury_ unreasonableness, holding that:
    
    > Judicial determination of _Wednesbury_ unreasonableness in Australia has in
    > practice been rare.  Nothing in these reasons should be taken as
    > encouragement to greater frequency. This is a rare case.

    _Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li_ [2013] HCA 18, [113] (Gageler J).

3.  Although Gageler J was satisfied that the Tribunal had acted unreasonably, its refusal
    to delay directly affected the Tribunal's ultimate decision. The delay was sought pending
    the review of a 'skills assessment' which was unfavourable to the applicant. Ultimately,
    the review resulted in an assessment favouring the applicant. The Tribunal relied on the
    erroneous skills assessment in deciding the refuse the applicant a visa. In contrast,
    the Delay Request in this case was for the purpose of providing further information which
    the Minister might have regard to, not for the purpose of correcting information which
    the Minister was required to rely on.

    _Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li_ [2013] HCA 18, [122] (Gageler J).
 
3.  In _Tarkine National Coalition_, this Court considered an application for judicial  
    review of a Ministerial decision under the _EPBC Act_. Although the application
    was successful, the Court rejected the ground of review alleging _Wednesbury_
    unreasonableness, noting Gageler J's observation.

    _Tarkine National Coalition Incorporated v Minister for Sustainability,
    Environment, Water, Population and Communities_ [2013] FCA 694, [84] (Marshall J).

4.  It is not the function of the Court to substitute its own decision for that
    of the Minister. For the Court to intervene on the ground of unreasonableness
    would require "something overwhelming."

    _Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd_ [1986] HCA 40; \
    (1986) 162 CLR 24, 40-41 (Mason J).

    _Tarkine National Coalition Incorporated v Minister for Sustainability,
    Environment, Water, Population and Communities_ [2013] FCA 694, [85] (Marshall J).

     230 (Lord Green MR).
