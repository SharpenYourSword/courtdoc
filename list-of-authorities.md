Statement of material facts
===========================

1.  On 30 July 2013, the Minister approved the proposal (**Decision**).
    The Minister’s reasons for the Decision (**Reasons**) stated that:

    1.  in deciding to approve the taking of the action, the Minister had
        given strong consideration to a recent Commonwealth government
        policy announcement that it would ’streamline’ environmental
        approval of offshore gas projects and ‘cut environmental green tape’
        in order to ensure that the Australia offshore gas industry remained
        competitive and attractive to international investment;

    2.  he had not delayed the decision in response to FNW’s letter, as
        he considered that adequate time had been given for public comment in
        compliance with the provisions of the EPBC Act.

Submission 1: The Minister did not make the Decision according to a rule or policy without regard to the merits of the particular case.
======================

1.  A lawful policy is normally a relevant consideration which a decision-maker
