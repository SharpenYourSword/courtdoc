Statement of facts
==================

# Submission 1: The Minister did not make the Decision according to a rule or policy without regard to the merits of the particular case.

1.  A lawful policy is normally a relevant consideration which a 
    decision-maker is bound to take into account.

2.  In Drake, the Court said:

    > The propriety of paying regard to general policy considerations is most
    > evident in a case such as the present where there are no speciﬁed
    > statutory criteria for the exercise of the discretionary power and
    > where the power is entrusted to a Minister of the Crown responsible to
    > Parliament.

# Submission 2: The Minister’s refusal to delay the decision was reasonable in the circumstances.

1. Wednesbury unreasonableness
